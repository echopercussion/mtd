# MTD: Metrics
An Overwatch Stat Tracker w/ Metrics That Diff


## NOTE:
This project is pre-alpha, and we aren't even close to a ready version of it yet. You can clone and experiment, however we don't really have any guidelines or a todo list beyond make it function atm. Expect documentation and a proper working alpha coming soon.

This project is written in Rust using Yew for WebAssembly. Why? Because we wanted to learn it. Could we have done this in TypeScript easier and faster, ofc but thats not the point. Along side this project I've been developing a components library called rainfrog, which like this project is still highly experimental however in the future, the hope is that contributers can use that library to quickly and painlessly add experimental functionality to our metrics app using the skeleton we set up.
